I was able to patch in the `dpkg-shlibdeps --sysroot` argument. The attached patch monkey-patches the system directly (not the packages that provide the patched files).


See the `README` file in the repo [1] that builds a Docker image containing the cross-build environment. I've successfully built (but not tested) packages, and regression tests pass on a manually-built source tree transferred to a native ARM host. In the next several days, I'll be able to do more testing, but the initial results look pretty promising.
