                            AXIOM OMPSS tests
===============================================================================

# Tests

This directory contains the following tests:
	* ompss_evimm	
	  This example implements Matrix Multiplication on top of Ompss		

	* n-body
	  This example simulate the evolution of a system of particles
	  using the Newton's law of universal gravitation
	  (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem).

# How to compile

To cross-compile all the test for ompss and install into the target file-system:
```
  make tests-ompss
  make target
```
(from the scripts/ directory)

or

```
  make install
  make target
```

(from this directory)

A
```
make help
```
show possible make targets.

## How to run

To run in the guests, choose one guest and do the following:
```
   cd /root/tests_ompss
   ./run_test_ompss.sh ./test??? [parameters]
```
The parameters are specific of every test and, usually, can be show using the --help command line options.

### How to run n-body benachmark/test

To run in the guest, do
```
cd /root/tests_ompss/
./run_test_nbody.sh particles-1024-128-100.in
```
The file particles-1024-128-100.in is using to build the initial system.
After the computation end the result system is written into 'particles-1024-128-100.out' and compared against 'particles-1024-128-100.ref' to check for failure.

# Run a suite of tests

See ../README.
