   Tests written for OmpSS programming model
 * gasnet	
   Regression tests and specific tests for GASNet
 * axiom	
   Tests writter for Axiom API

 * utils
   Contains some utilities for the host and guests:

	* guest

# Run a suite of tests

Tests are groupped into suites that can be run automatically.
For example to run the 'core' suite of tests for gasnet

```
cd tests/gasnet
make tests-core

```
a

```
make help
```

show the available suites.

Note that the system must be already running; you must ```make start```
to run a 2 nodes system and then launch ```/root/axim-startup.sh``
in every node (in one node use the '-m' flag) as already described.
