                            AXIOM NIC simulation
===============================================================================
== Intro ==

To try the AXIOM NIC simulator you can '''download the VDI image''' or
'''download the tarball''' or '''clone the repository'''.

== Download the VDI image ==

The VDI image contains Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS for x86_64 architecture with source
and precompiled version of the AXIOM NIC simulator<br>
You can download the VDI image from this link: XXXXXXX

Guest directories:

#~/axiom-git <br> contains the axiom-evi repository already cloned with all submodules (README inside)
#~/axiom-archive <br> contains tarball archives with all components precompiled (README in each archive)

== Download the tarball ==

The tarball contains the precompiled version of the AXIOM NIC simulator with
QEMU (+ Axiom NIC emulation) and the buildroot filesystem with the
Axiom user-space application. <br>
The README explains how to run the simulation.<br>
You can download the latest tarball from this link: XXXXX

== Clone the repository ==
