    + add multiple waitqueue (one per port)
    + add unique message ID in each packets (RAW and RDMA)
* QEMU
    + add RDMA emulation support
    + fix qemu backend reordering issue (patch sent to qemu-devel mailing list)
* User space library
    + add RDMA APIs:
        - axiom_rdma_write()
        - axiom_rdma_read()
        - axiom_rdma_mmap() / axiom_rdma_unmmap()
        - axiom_set_flags() / axiom_unset_flags()
    + add AXIOM_PORT_ANY to bind a random port available
    + add new flags: AXIOM_FLAGS_NOBLOCK and AXIOM_FLAG_NOFLUSH
    + small bug fixes

    + update datasheet and documentation following latest specification agreed
      with FORTH

## axiom-v0.6
* axiom-nic / QEMU
    + new registers layout provided by FORTH:
        - only one descriptor per queue memory mapped to the CPU

    + add no-blocking I/O support
    + use IOCTL to send/recv messages
    + add new APIs:
        - axiom_get_num_nodes()
        - axiom_send_raw_avail() / axiom_recv_raw_avail()
        - axiom_flush_raw()
    + small bug fixes
* User space applications
    + axiom-netperf
        - add more statistics
        - use new payload size to increase the performance
    + axiom-info
        - print more information
    + axiom-send-raw / axiom-recv-raw
        - add support to non-blocking I/O
        - more useful parameters
        - payload specified as a list of bytes
    + axiom-init
        - fix routing table overwrite
    + axiom-ping
        - improve code using separated thread to send messages

    + axiom-info
    + axiom-ping
    + axiom-traceroute
    + axiom-netperf
* axiom-nic
    + support for bind and port forwarding
* axiom_switch
    + mesh-2D topology auto-generation
    + additional topology support from file
    + communicate to QEMU the connected interface
* QEMU
    + fixed socket backend to avoid packet loss
    + support of control packet from the axiom_switch
* other small fixes

## axiom-v0.3.1
* small fixes
* first public release to the AXIOM partners

## axiom-v0.3
* QEMU
    + support for the register specification in the frontend
